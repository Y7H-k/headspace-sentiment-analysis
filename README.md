# Headspace Sentiment Analysis

This project analyzes 2,000 user reviews from the Apple App Store using sentiment analysis and NLP to evaluate the effectiveness of the Headspace app.

- Scraped reviews using `app_store_scraper`
- Applied TextBlob to calculate sentiment polarity
- Normalized star ratings and visualized correlations
- Performed regression analysis to evaluate the relationship between sentiment and ratings

R-squared value: 0.962 â€” showing a strong positive correlation.

This project was completed as part of a team for DS2500 at Northeastern University.

This GitHub includes the code I personally contributed and preserved from our collaboration.
